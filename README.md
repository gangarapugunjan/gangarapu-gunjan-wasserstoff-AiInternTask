# AI Pipeline for Image Segmentation and Object Analysis

## Overview

This project develops an AI pipeline for processing images to segment, identify, and analyze objects within them. The pipeline is designed to perform the following steps:

1. **Image Segmentation**: Segment objects in the input images.
2. **Object Identification**: Use machine learning models to identify and describe each segmented object.
3. **Text Extraction**: Extract relevant text data from identified objects using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
4. **Attribute Summarization**: Summarize the attributes of each object using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
5. **Data Mapping**: Map extracted information, including unique IDs, descriptions, text, and summaries, to the master input image.
6. **Output Generation**: Generate a visual output that displays the original image with annotations and a summary table of all mapped data.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - OpenCV
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch
  - Tesseract OCR / EasyOCR
  - YOLO / Faster R-CNN / CLIP
  - Streamlit
  - Matplotlib
  - Pandas
- **Data Formats**: JSON / SQL

## Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-segmentation-object-analysis.git
cd image-segmentation-object-analysis

Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can create a virtual environment using venv or conda.

Using venv:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Step 3: Install Required Packages
Install the necessary libraries using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 4: Prepare Input Images
Place your input images in the specified directory (e.g., input_images/). Ensure the images are in a supported format (e.g., JPG, PNG).

Step 5: Configure Models and Parameters
Modify the configuration files or parameters as needed to specify the models (YOLO, Faster R-CNN, etc.) and settings you want to use for segmentation, identification, and OCR.

Step 6: Run the Pipeline
You can run the main script to start processing the images:
python main.py

This will execute the entire pipeline, performing segmentation, identification, text extraction, summarization, and output generation.

Step 7: Review Output
Upon completion, the pipeline will generate:

A visual output image showing the original image with segmented objects and annotations.
A summary table in a specified format (e.g., CSV, JSON) containing all mapped data related to each object and the master image.
Step 8: Using the Streamlit UI (Optional)
If you have implemented a Streamlit UI for testing, you can run it as follows:
streamlit run app.py

Access the Streamlit interface in your web browser at http://localhost:8501.

Usage Guidelines
Input Images: Ensure your input images are placed in the designated folder (input_images/) before running the pipeline.

Adjust Parameters: Modify configuration files or the main script to set parameters such as model paths, thresholds, and other settings to suit your needs.

Execution: Run the pipeline through the command line or the Streamlit UI.

Output Handling: Review the generated images and summary tables to verify results. Adjust configurations and rerun as necessary for improved results.
